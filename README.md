Firefox OS app for an English-German dictionary, see https://schnark.github.io/install.html?id=deng for more information.

Note that this repository is managed as described in https://xkcd.com/1597/.

This app is based on `ding` by Frank Richter, see https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~fri/ding/

The dictionary is just a copy, and the design is much inspired, but otherwise this app is completely independent from the original.

To avoid confusion this app is called `deng`, which also expresses the fact that (at least currently) it only works for German and English.
